# 🏀 Predicting Basketball Game Outcomes: Michael Jordan vs. LeBron James  
**Using Logistic Regression**

This repository focuses on predicting the outcomes of basketball games between two NBA legends, Michael Jordan and LeBron James, using logistic regression. The dataset contains game statistics from their careers, sourced from nba-reference.com. This analysis aims to compare their performances based on various game metrics and predict future outcomes.

### 🚀 Key Insights from the Logistic Regression Model

#### 1. **Model Accuracy**  
The logistic regression model performed well, demonstrating good accuracy on both the training and testing datasets. This indicates the model's reliability in predicting the outcome of games.

#### 2. **Suitability of Logistic Regression**  
Logistic Regression is ideal for binary classification tasks (win/loss), as it outputs probabilities, making it easy to interpret results and analyze predictions.

#### 3. **Model Evaluation**  
Based on the confusion matrix, the model showed a high number of correct predictions for both winning and losing categories. However, some misclassifications remain, which could be improved with further model refinement.

### 💡 Key Insights from the Data

#### 1. **Feature Importance**  
- **Points and Game Score**: Directly influenced predictions, as they reflect a player's contribution to game outcomes.  
- **Age**: Strongly correlated with performance, suggesting that experience and stamina play a role in winning games.

#### 2. **Winning Patterns**  
- Players with higher scores (from field goals, free throws, and three-pointers) had a better chance of winning, highlighting the importance of shooting efficiency.

#### 3. **Winning Probability**  
- The model outputs the probability of winning, which provides additional insight into the model’s confidence in each prediction.

#### 4. **Data Cleaning**  
- The analysis identified features with missing values that were not utilized, demonstrating the importance of focusing on relevant features without wasting resources on unnecessary data.
